Maureen stood up from the rusty old harvester she was repairing and wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her sleeve. "It’s the bias-gyro" she sighed to herself, taking a break and looking out at the low setting sun. A gentle gust rippled across the sweeping golden wheat plains. The huge derelict terraforming towers in the distance glinting in the evening light.

She took a packet of cigarettes out of the top pocket of her flannelette shirt and tapped one out, casually lighting it and taking a long drag. She looked up admiring two shiptrails that hung in the sky, undisturbed by the warm calm air. Trade with the colonies had been slower than ever and even with harvest around the corner the skies were very quiet.

If this gyro hadn’t failed that crop would be up in two days and ready for shipment to port Kova. She thought. But now she was going to have to drive into town to see if Finnegan had spare parts. Another day off her schedule.

High above the horizon Maureen watched a glow appear. A ship entering atmosphere. It’s little light getting brighter, it’s streaking trail growing longer. Then she noticed another glow appear not far behind it. “Unusual” she thought, watching the pair of ships. But then another appeared. And another. And another.

Horrified Mo froze, watching as a formation of thirteen or ships burned across the distant sky. Than across the valley, as if the wind was calling, came the long haunting call of the raid-siren. Wailing out across the landscape. “Fuck!” She gasped, breaking into a run for the farmhouse.
