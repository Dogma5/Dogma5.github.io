## History

## Conflicts

### Raiders
Deep-space raiders have recently taken to seeing _Steppe_ as an easy target.
Too far away from main _empire_ military routes and not well protected. The raiders often raid towns and leave before any organised retaliation.

### Organised crime
Family run entrepreneurial firms

## Geography
### General characteristics
Long ago terraformed into a grain harvesting planet the majority of the surface of Steppe is covered in great plains, great lakes and gorges. Some mountain ranges make up the equator known as the Belt Ranges. Old Terraforming towers can be seen scattered across the landscape. However most are in disrepair as  has given up, gone bust, ~~or maybe the Terraforming is complete.~~

### Geology
