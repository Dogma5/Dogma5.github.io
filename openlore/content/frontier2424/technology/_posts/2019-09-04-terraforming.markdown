Terraforming is the act of intentionally modifying the atmosphere of a naturally inhabitable planet or moon to become sufficient for human life.

Terraforming is an incredibly expensive and time consuming operation requiring a large investment and decades to complete. The viability of terraforming depends greatly on the initial conditions of the planet and the desired outcome.

## Primary providers
Few corporations have the capital to sustain terraforming for the length of time required to see a return on investment.

- [Pavlov Intergalactic](/frontier2424/factions/pavlovintergalactic/) The largest provider of Terraforming solutions.

## Terraforming Towers
The most stable and typical method of Terraforming involves the erection of large Terraforming Towers. Designed to intake vast quantities of atmosphere to filter out undesirable compounds, chemically transform and introduce new useful chemicals.
