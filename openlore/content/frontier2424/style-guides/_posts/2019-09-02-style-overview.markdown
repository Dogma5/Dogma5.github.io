The world of Frontier2424 is gritty and authentic. Space is hard to survive in. Frontier settlements are isolated and under supplied. Technology is clunky and practical. People are tired and desperate. The frontier is just that, the frontier of human existence.

The main themes in Frontier2424 are more about survival, determination and human perseverance than our technical prowess, and the world-building is intended to support that.

## Verisimilitude

Frontier2424 creations should feel more akin to westerns and military genres than to glossy futuristic science fiction.

The lo-fi sci-fi feel of Frontier2424 is intentional, intended to assist in delivering the themes of survival and perseverance. Technology is designed to be robust and is often battered from years of use causing it to become unreliable and in need of repair. — Technology won’t save you.

## Science

The intended audience for Frontier2424 is intelligent but the goal is not to appease physicists or astronauts.

In the Frontier2424 universe suspension of disbelief is carefully balanced. Creators should strive for something that feels authentic and believable in the harsh conditions of frontier space colonisation.

Space faring vessels have gravity drives and drop-ships look as if they can sustain lift. However this is not hard-core scifi and the physics details of how artificial gravity works, or the aerodynamics required for atmospheric escape, are unlikely to be explored deeply.

## Vehicles

No flying cars. Practical.

## Biohazards

Work in progress

## Design

Gritty, authentic, lived-in.

### Space is dark.
Fresh air and power are a luxury so ships and stations are claustrophobic and poorly lit.

### Landscapes are earthly
Much to the surprise of the first settlers, extraterrestrial landscapes and flora are not that visually different from the more exotic regions of earth and are rarely flamboyant or surreal.

### Fauna is familiar’ish
Extraterrestrial animals are incredibly rare. But as there are few practical solutions to biological locomotion, most fauna has typically evolved towards taking shapes similar to mammals, birds and insects on earth.

### Clothing and technology is practical
Equipment on the frontier has practical function and as such, form tends to follow function. Machinery is typically industrial and hardy. Cloths are weathered and lived in.

## Cultures

Cultural and racial diversity in Frontier2424 can be rich and layered. Just like the early colonization of earth spawned new and unique cultures, so too did the colonization of space. With the increased distance of travel and time between communication the smaller more isolated colonies came into their own.

Religion is mostly considered superstition and antiquated in the more populated sectors of the universe. However rare it might be it is not necessarily shunned or frowned upon.

## Language

With the intention for an authentic and practical feeling, the language used in Frontier2424 is often interlaced with naval, military, and industrial concepts.

Much of the vernacular for life onboard space “ships” is inspired by real world naval vocabulary, this helps ground science fiction concepts in a believable way. Vessels are docked. Crews escape on lifeboats, and the captain is on the bridge.

## Are we alone?

{:.draft}
Intelligent life has yet to be discovered.

Some extremists sects believe that the parracite introduced during the tech-plague may have been sentient and our first-contact.
