# About Openlore

Openlore is a collection of shared universes created for the soul purpose of giving artists room to explore and collaborate without fear of legal ramifications.

We currently live in a world of franchises and copyright where even personal fan-fiction can come under legal attack. For the creative who has been inspired by their favorite franchise this can be an unfortunately stifling situation.

## How it works.

Openlore only makes money if you make money.
